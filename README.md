This is a quick mono interface on top of avconv that I put together to make it easier for my daughters to convert their pictures into video for some stop motion experiments.

Only tested on our copies of Ubuntu 14.04 and no where else yet.

Installing the mono runtime and gtksharp should install everything needed
